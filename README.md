Scaling Mobile Code Offloading
==============================

Experiences and lessons learned regarding scaling a computational offloading deployment in the cloud. This project is an extension from our initial framework used to [benchmark Android-x86](https://github.com/huberflores/BenchmarkingAndroidx86). The main contribution of this project is the extra front-end component that distributes the code offloading requests among the active servers.
